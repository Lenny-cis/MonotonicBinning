#### <p align="center"> Monotonic Optimal Binning (MOB) </p>
##### <p align="center">  for Consumer Credit Risk Scorecard Development </p>

This reposity hosts a collection of R functions that would generate the monotonice binning employed in consumer credit scorecard developments. 

The function [manual_bin()](https://github.com/statcompute/MonotonicBinning/blob/master/code/manual_bin.R) is the building block of all binning algorithms introduced here and will generate the binning outcome based upon a list of cutting points for each attribute.
